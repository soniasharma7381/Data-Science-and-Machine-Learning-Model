# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Model : Lead Score

An education company sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead.

**The Goal of this Regression Model is :**

- To assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

- Recommendations based on the model results to adjust common problem that companies face based in data provided.
